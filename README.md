# Seismic-Interferometry

Simple codes for seismic interferometry implementing the method described in Gouedard et al., 2014, for the correction of Ocean Bottom Seismometer clocks (https://doi.org/10.1785/0120130157). It calculates first the noise cross-correlation functions and then perform the time symmetry analysis and the virtual doublet analysis. Also provided is a part of OBS data used in Gouedard et al., 2014, to test the code.
